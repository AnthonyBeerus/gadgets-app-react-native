(node:31908) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Dev/Muse/gadgets-app-react-native/scripts/check-supabase.ts is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\Dev\Muse\gadgets-app-react-native\package.json.
