# Expo Development Skills

When working on tasks related to the following topics, you MUST consult the corresponding skill file before proceeding:

| Topic | Skill Reference |
|-------|-----------------|
| API routes, server-side logic, webhooks | @.agent/skills/api-routes/SKILL.md |
| UI components, navigation, styling, animations | @.agent/skills/building-ui/SKILL.md |
| CI/CD pipelines, EAS workflows, automated deployments | @.agent/skills/cicd-workflows/SKILL.md |
| Fetch, API calls, React Query, caching, offline support | @.agent/skills/data-fetching/SKILL.md |
| App Store, Play Store, web hosting, EAS deploy | @.agent/skills/deployment/SKILL.md |
| Development builds, TestFlight, custom Expo Go | @.agent/skills/dev-client/SKILL.md |
| Tailwind CSS, NativeWind, react-native-css | @.agent/skills/tailwind-setup/SKILL.md |
| SDK upgrades, breaking changes, deprecated packages | @.agent/skills/upgrading-expo/SKILL.md |
| DOM components, web libraries in native, webview | @.agent/skills/use-dom/SKILL.md |

## Enforcement

- **Always check skills first** before implementing features in these domains
- **Follow skill patterns exactly** — they contain tested, working code
- **Consult reference docs within skills** when they point to additional resources
- **Use `Expo Go` first** before creating custom dev builds (per building-ui skill)
- **Prefer skill recommendations** for library choices (e.g., `expo-symbols` over `@expo/vector-icons`)
