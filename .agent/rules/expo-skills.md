## Enforcement

- **Always check skills first** before implementing features in these domains
- **Follow skill patterns exactly** — they contain tested, working code
- **Consult reference docs within skills** when they point to additional resources
- **Use `Expo Go` first** before creating custom dev builds (per building-ui skill)
- **Prefer skill recommendations** for library choices (e.g., `expo-symbols` over `@expo/vector-icons`)
