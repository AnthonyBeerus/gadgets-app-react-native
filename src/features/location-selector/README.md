# Location Selector Feature

## Overview
The Location Selector allows users to choose a specific mall or "All Locations" to filter the shop content. It features a custom animated header using `react-native-reanimated`.

## Structure
- `screens/`: Screen components (e.g., `LocationSelectorScreen`)
- `components/`: (Currently empty, header logic is inline for scroll coordination)

## Dependencies
- `react-native-reanimated`: For the custom header animation
- `shared/store/shop-store`: For accessing and updating selected mall state
- `shared/constants`: Uses `NEO_THEME` for styling

## Testing
Run tests using `npm test` (tests to be implemented).
