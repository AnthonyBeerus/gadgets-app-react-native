# API Routes

This directory contains the Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) API routes for the application.
Routes are built using Expo Router API Routes features.

## Structure
- Each folder represents a resource (e.g., `products`, `orders`).
- `index+api.ts` handles the root endpoint for that resource.
- `[id]+api.ts` handles dynamic ID routes.
